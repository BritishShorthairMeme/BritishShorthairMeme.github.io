British Shorthair Meme is a very different project to most other tokens. Because is very useful for communities that have BSM token. Because without anyone trading BSM tokens in the market, holders will still get their dividends. Unlike most other tokens which only get dividends when there are trade transactions on the market!.

BSM token will be delegates in the Polygon network, this effort is to support Polygon projects to be more developed and of higher quality in the future.

Delegation funds are obtained from BSM community contributions based on token allocation:
 • 20% for Co-Founder Polygon
 • 30% for the contributing community
 • 50% for Liquidity Pool

30% this is what we will use for delegation in the Polygon network. The details are as follows.
 • 10% used for liquidity pool
 • 90% used for delegation

Community benefits that contribute will get Matic token rewards, when the delegation ends. 40% Matic token rewards obtained from delegates will be distributed to BSM token holders and 60% will be added to the delegate's balance so that the next dividend will increase.

This delegation is not done once but will be repeated continuously. So that BSM token holders will get benefits in the form of Matic token dividends every delegation ends.
